Neural-Key-Exchange-Protocol
============================

Proof of concept dealing with NKEP written in Python. If you don't know what NKEP is, see http://cryptome.org/neuralsub.ps for more info and look up Tree Parity Machines.

NOTE: The random number generator used in this program is NOT secure. Do not even think about using this for anything requiring secrecy. This is just an exercise of understanding.
